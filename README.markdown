RecipeMonster
=============

Apologies if you're here looking for something to manage your recipes! This app is a very simple
demo app built for a talk on the Core Data Queue Confinement model that I presented at the
2011 Apple University Consortium /dev/world conference.

In the spirit of WWDC demos, the demo is based around storing recipes.

Slides/video
------------

You can see a screencast with audio recording of the talk courtesy of the Apple University Consortium
on their website: [http://auc.edu.au/2011/09/well-managed-object-contexts/](http://auc.edu.au/2011/09/well-managed-object-contexts/)

The presentation without the audio or the code demo isn't that informative, but if you really want that you can watch
the slideshow on [iWork.com](http://public.iwork.com/document/?d=Well_Managed_Objects.key&a=p11413129)
