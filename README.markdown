RecipeMonster
=============

Apologies if you're here looking for something to manage your recipes! This app is a very simple
demo app built for a talk on the Core Data Queue Confinement model that I presented at the
2011 Apple University Consortium /dev/world conference.

In the spirit of WWDC demos, the demo is based around storing recipes.

Slides/video
------------

In the next few weeks the video will be uploaded and I'll provide a link here pointing to that.
